* What is this?
A live repository of my ~/.emacs.d with various settings organized into org heading
* How does it work?
~/.emacs.d/init.el is read by emacs the normal way then it runs org-babel-load-file to parse the ~/.emacs.d/settings.org file 
* What does settings.org contain?
- It's a normal org file with headings
- Subtrees that start with #+BEGIN_SRC and end with #+END_SRC are interpreted by org-babel-load-file
* What's the advantage of doing things this way?
- A better organized emacs configuration and compatibility with the rest of your org-sphere.
- You can add notes and headlines into your settings file without it being parsed by emacs.
